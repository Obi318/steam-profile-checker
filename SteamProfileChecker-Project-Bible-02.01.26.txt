Below is a complete, definitive Project Bible + a bulletproof backup/package checklist (zip + environment + “how to restore”). It’s written so you can paste it into a single doc called something like PROJECT_BIBLE.md inside the repo.

Steam Profile Checker — Project Bible (Beta v1.1)
1) What this project is

Steam Profile Checker is a lightweight web app that takes a public Steam profile URL (or vanity name / SteamID64) and outputs a Trust Score (0–100) plus a clean breakdown of the public “signals” used to compute it.

It is explicitly not a cheat detector. It’s a “quick risk snapshot” to help you decide “is this person likely legit?” using public indicators.

2) Current status (where we are now)
Frontend (✅ shippable beta)

Next.js app (App Router) using /app/page.js.

UI: dark “Steam-y” aesthetic, clean spacing, premium glassy panels.

Input supports:

Steam profile URL

vanity name

SteamID64

Optional game dropdown to add context via playtime hours (hours can slightly adjust score).

Results card shows:

avatar, personaName, Open profile link

created date, region, profile visibility (public/private)

verdict label (LIKELY LEGIT, etc.)

Trust Score + progress bar

signal rows: account age, steam level, selected game hours, bans, games owned

optional social links

API (✅ working)

/app/api/check/route.js

Accepts payload { input, selectedAppId, selectedGameName }

Uses Steam Web API + best-effort scraping/parsing where needed (depending on your current implementation)

Returns a structured JSON response consumed by the UI:

trustLevel, verdict, signals, scoreSummary, bans, etc.

Versioning

Current version shown in UI: v1.1 Beta

Current “ship candidate” is Beta v1.1.

3) Goals (where we’re going)
Product goals

Ship a public web version (simple URL, fast load, looks legit)

Make output “shareable” (copy link / share card image / “report URL”)

Make it sticky: encourage repeat checking and discovery

Monetize without ruining trust or UX

Key UX principles

It must feel simple + confident + non-accusatory

No “coder-guy” language

Must communicate: “public info summarized” in plain English

Must handle edge cases gracefully (private profiles, API fail, rate limits)

4) Monetization theory-crafting (clean + realistic)
The golden rule

Monetization must not make the app look like it’s selling accusations. You want “utility tool” vibes, not “witch hunt” vibes.

Monetization Option A (best first): “Pro features” upgrade

Free

Trust Score + basic signal breakdown

“Selected game hours” for one game

Basic verdict labels

Pro

“Deep read” breakdown (why the score changed, what moved it)

Multi-game check (choose up to 3 games)

Export/share tools:

“Shareable link” w/ snapshot

“Generate card image” (for Discord/Twitter)

History:

saved checks

compare two profiles

“Watchlist” (lightweight): track changes weekly/monthly (profile goes private, new ban, etc.)

Pricing idea:

$5/mo or $30/yr (keep it cheap; high conversion)

Monetization Option B: Ads (only if needed)

Only run ads below the fold (never near the trust score)

Keep it subtle

If ads ever cheapen trust, remove them

Monetization Option C: Affiliate traffic (low friction)

If you build “recommended services” later (anti-cheat communities, coaching, etc.) — but only if it fits your brand.

Keep this optional; do not lead with it.

5) Traffic + growth strategy
Phase 1: “Utility loop” (organic)

Users will share results naturally if you make sharing easy:

“Copy share link”

“Copy image for Discord”

Post it in:

Steam trading communities

CS2 / Rust / TF2 / Dota communities

Discord servers

Create short videos showing:

“How to spot suspicious Steam profiles quickly”

“Public signals that matter (age/level/bans)”

Keep tone: “helpful tool” not “gotcha.”

Phase 2: SEO pages (long-term traffic)

Add static pages:

/how-trust-score-works

/what-vac-bans-mean

/steam-profile-private-vs-public
These can rank.

Phase 3: Partnerships

Mods, Discord server owners, trading groups

Offer “Pro code” discounts to large communities

6) Roadmap (next builds)
v1.2 (next practical)

Share link (snapshot stored)

Better handling of rate limits + friendly errors

Support “compare two profiles”

Better “private profile” messaging

v1.3

Save history (optional login)

Pro tier with multi-game check + exports

v1.4+

Watchlist/notifications (if worth it)

Discord bot integration (very viral if done right)

Packaging + Backup Checklist (leave no stone unturned)
A) What to save (minimum ship bundle)

You want a bundle that lets you:

restore the project exactly

reinstall dependencies

preserve environment variable requirements

preserve the “known good beta” state

Must-have files/folders

✅ app/
✅ public/
✅ package.json
✅ package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml / yarn.lock)
✅ next.config.mjs
✅ postcss.config.js
✅ tailwind.config.js (if you have it)
✅ jsconfig.json or tsconfig.json
✅ .gitignore
✅ .env.local.example (important)
✅ PROJECT_BIBLE.md (the doc you’re making)

Do NOT include in the zip

❌ node_modules/ (waste of space; re-installable)
❌ .next/ (build output)
❌ .env.local (contains secrets—don’t share it)

B) The safest “final backup” method (recommended)
Step 1 — Clean the repo

Stop dev server.

Delete:

node_modules/

.next/

Step 2 — Create an env template

Make sure you have:

.env.local.example that contains placeholders like:

STEAM_WEB_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE

If you already do, perfect.

Step 3 — Add a “restore instructions” file

Create RESTORE.md with these instructions:

RESTORE.md

npm install

Copy .env.local.example → .env.local

Fill in STEAM_WEB_API_KEY

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000

Step 4 — Zip the project

Zip the project folder after removing node_modules + .next.

Windows quickest safe method

Right click folder → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder

Name it:

steam-checker_beta_v1.1_YYYY-MM-DD.zip

C) “Future thread / future you” handoff notes

In addition to the zip, save a tiny text file you can paste into the next thread:

HANDOFF.txt

Project name: Steam Profile Checker

Tech: Next.js (App Router), Node

Key files:

app/page.js (UI)

app/api/check/route.js (API)

Behavior:

empty input → defaults to Shroud example

games dropdown alphabetized, None first

Goal: ship to web + add share links + Pro tier later

Read: PROJECT_BIBLE.md, RESTORE.md

Optional (but high-value) “professional” safeguard
Put it in Git (even private/local)

If you aren’t already:

git init

commit the current beta state

tag it: v1.1-beta

That way you can always roll back even if something breaks later.

What I’d do next (very concrete)

Create PROJECT_BIBLE.md using the sections above.

Create RESTORE.md.

Ensure .env.local.example exists and is correct.

Delete node_modules + .next.

Zip folder.

(Optional) Commit + tag in Git.
